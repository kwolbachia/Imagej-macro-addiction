About preview Opener :
open all the images of one directory or just the ones you want, no problem if as virtual stacks
adjust all you want (slice, contrast, LUTs..) because the snapshots will show the current views.
then double clic on the tool to create the snapshot montage. It's supposed to work on any image format.
save it as tiff on the same directory, don't rename it!
Now when you click on this preview montage with the tool, it will open the image you clicked ! (provided they all are in one directory)
