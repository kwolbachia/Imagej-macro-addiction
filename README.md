About preview Opener :   
First:   
open all the images of one directory or just the ones you want,   
no problem if they are virtual stacks.  
Adjust the display you want (slice, contrast, LUTs..) because the snapshots will show the current views.   
Then double clic on the tool to create the snapshot montage. It's supposed to work on any image format.    
save it as tiff on the same directory, don't rename it!    
Now when you click on this preview montage with the tool, it will open the image you clicked ! (provided everything is on the same directory)
