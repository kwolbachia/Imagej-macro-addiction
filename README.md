About the [Interactive Wand Tool](https://github.com/kwolbachia/Imagej-macro-addiction/blob/main/Interactive_Wand_Tool.ijm) :   
The tool will detect local contrast (5 pixel box) on click and estimate the right Wand tolerance.      
Drag mouse laterally to adjust tolerance if needed.       
Click with the mouse wheel on a selection to add it to ROI Manager.
Double click on Tool to adjust parameters. 

About the [Preview Opener](https://github.com/kwolbachia/Imagej-macro-addiction/blob/main/Preview%20Opener.ijm) :   
First : open all the images of one directory or just the ones you want, it can be virtual stacks.  
Adjust the display you want (slice, contrast, LUTs..) because the snapshots will show the current views.   
Then double click (or right click) on the tool to create the snapshot montage. It's supposed to work on any image format.    
Save it as tiff on the same directory, don't rename it!    
Now when you click on this preview montage with the tool, it will open the image you clicked ! (provided everything is on the same directory)   

About the [LUTs from montage Tool](https://github.com/kwolbachia/Imagej-macro-addiction/blob/main/LUTs_from_montage.ijm) :    
Double click (or right click) on the tool to get the imageJ LUTs montage.    
Select the image you want to target by clicking on it (it should blink in orange)     
then just click on the LUT you want on the montage.     
Also, if you click with this tool on another rgb image(ie a rainbow), it will create a linear LUT from the rgb pixel color!
