how to install macro tools : <https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-20.html>

About preview Opener :   
First : open all the images of one directory or just the ones you want,   
no problem if they are virtual stacks.  
Adjust the display you want (slice, contrast, LUTs..) because the snapshots will show the current views.   
Then double click on the tool to create the snapshot montage. It's supposed to work on any image format.    
save it as tiff on the same directory, don't rename it!    
Now when you click on this preview montage with the tool, it will open the image you clicked ! (provided everything is on the same directory)   

About the LUTs from montage Tool :    
Double click on the tool to get the imageJ LUTs montage
select the image you want to target by clicking on it (it should blink in orange)     
then just click on the LUT you want on the montage.     
Also, if you click with this tool on another rgb image(ie a rainbow), it will create a linear LUT from the rgb pixel color!
